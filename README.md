# SoundRecognition

Upload of my contribution to this project, and research paper of my findings and Cameron Rho's work on GANS model.

Pytorch project using Linear, CNN and ResNet classifiers on spectrograms from IRMAS dataset
that measured performances changes in regards to accuracy and overfitting by what classifier model, resolution
of spectrogram, and effects of segmenting larger samples into smaller ones.
